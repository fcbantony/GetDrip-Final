Website changes & content naming


Index.php

General Changes:		Put the header section of website into Includes/header.php
						Put the modals into Includes/modals.php
						Added login/logout scripts, signin/signout nav button changes accordingly
						Signing out destroys the session. THIS MIGHT BE WRONG, I DON'T KNOW.


Sign-In modal form:		email input name 		= signInEmail
						password input name 	= signInPassword
						submit button			= signInSubmit

						Modal automatically shows while there is a sign-in error. To cancel the sign-in and remove the error, the
						user much click the green close button.

Contact Us form:		removed the "php-email-form" class from the form in order to facilitate the post to php.

Known Issues:			Footer home button still links to index.html, change to .php
						login.php calls to a dummy database, remember to change over to real one when it gets made
